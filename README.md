> Symfony Bundle for the Contentful Delivery SDK. This bundle requires PHP 7.2 or higher or PHP 8.0 or higher, and Symfony 3.4 or higher. It also requires Twig to be installed.

# Setup

Add this package to your application by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and executing the following command:

``` bash
composer require contentful/contentful-bundle
```

## Add ContentfulBundle to your application

``` php
// config/bundles.php
return [
    // ...
    Contentful\ContentfulBundle\ContentfulBundle::class => ['dev' => true],
    // ...
];
```

## Configuration example

The simplest configuration includes just the space ID and token. Add these settings to either `app/config.yml` (Symfony 3) or create `config/packages/contentful.yaml` (Symfony 4):

``` yaml
contentful:
    delivery:
        main:
            space: cfexampleapi
            token: b4c0n73n7fu1
```

You can also configure multiple clients and enable the preview mode:

``` yaml
contentful:
    delivery:
        main:
            default: true
            space: cfexampleapi
            token: b4c0n73n7fu1
        preview:
            space: cfexampleapi
            token: b4c0n73n7fu1
            api: preview
```

## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.
